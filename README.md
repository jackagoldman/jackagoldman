### Hi I'm Jack 👋

I am a disturbance ecologist 🔥 and environmental data scientist 📈 💻, and currently a PhD candidate in the [James lab](https://www.jameslab.ca/) and [Fortin lab](https://fortin.eeb.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto.

My PhD research is mostly thinking about how climate change 🥵 and insect disturbance 🐛 affect wildfire burn severity 🔥 in the boreal forest 🌲. I also spend a lot of time thinking about how winter climate change 🌨️ is going to affect boreal ecosystems, from wildlife to wildfire. I am facinated by the world of remote sensing 🛰️ and how ecologists leverage remotely sensed data to better understand to role of disturbances in shaping forest ecosystem resilience and recovery to climate change.

I am passioante about open and reproducible science. On my GitHub are all the projects I am currently working on, as well as past research projects.
