### Hi I'n Jack 👋

I am a disturbance ecologist and environmental data scientist, and currently a PhD candidate in the [James lab](https://www.jameslab.ca/) and the [Fortin lab](https://fortin.eeb.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto.

My PhD research is mostly thinking about how climate change and insect disturbance affect wildfire burn severity in the boreal forest.
